    st.markdown("""When you are building a Machine Learning model, you need to follow a series of steps to prepare 
    the data and build the model. The following are the key steps in the Machine Learning process:
    
    - **    Data Collection**: is the process of collecting the data from various sources such as CSV files, databases, 
    APIs, etc. One of the most famous websites for datasets is [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/). <br> <br>
    
    - **    Data Cleaning**: is the process of cleaning the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, 
    handling outliers, etc. This step is very important because at most times the data is not clean and contains a lot 
    of missing values and outliers. <br> <br>
    
    - **    Data Preprocessing**: is the process of transforming the data into a format that is suitable for analysis. 
    This includes handling categorical features, handling numerical features, scaling and transformation, etc. <br> <br>
    - **    Feature Engineering**: is the process that manipulate with the features itself. It consists of multiple 
    steps such as feature extraction, feature transformation, and feature selection. <br> <br>
    
    - **    Splitting the Data**: is the process of splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The 
    training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters, and the testing set
     is used to evaluate the model. <br> <br>
     
    - **    Building Machine Learning Models**: is the process of building the Machine Learning models. There are many 
    Machine Learning models that can be used for classification and regression tasks. Some of the most famous models are
     Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest 
     Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks. <br> <br>
     
    - **    Evaluating Machine Learning Models**: is the process of evaluating the Machine Learning models using various
     metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and many more for classification tasks and mean squared 
     error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared for regression tasks.
      <br> <br>
      
    - **    Tuning Hyperparameters**: is the process of tuning the hyperparameters of the Machine Learning models to get
     the best model. There are many hyperparameters that can be tuned for each model such as the number of estimators 
     for Random Forest, the number of neighbors for KNN, the number of layers and neurons for Neural Networks, and many 
     more. <br> <br>

                ###Overview of Regression Models

        Regression models are a fundamental class of machine learning models used for predicting numerical values. In this section, we will explore two main types of regression models: linear regression and non-linear regression.

        ####  Linear Regression

        Linear regression is a widely used regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.

        There are two types of linear regression:

        - **Simple Linear Regression**: In simple linear regression, we have one independent variable (feature) and one dependent variable (target). The model fits a straight line to the data to predict the target variable.

        - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to include multiple independent variables. It considers the linear relationship between multiple features and the target variable.

        #### Non-Linear Regression

        Non-linear regression models capture more complex relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Unlike linear regression, non-linear regression does not assume a linear relationship. It allows for curves, exponential functions, polynomial functions, and other non-linear patterns.

        Non-linear regression can be useful when the relationship between variables is not linear and requires a more flexible model to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Various algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector regression, and neural networks, can be used to perform non-linear regression.

        ## 📏 Linear Regression


        Linear Regression is a widely used and versatile algorithm for predicting numerical values. It models the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to the data. The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.

        --- 

        ### Examples


        Linear Regression can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as:

        - **Housing Prices**: Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, location, etc.
        - **Stock Market Analysis**: Forecasting stock prices based on historical data and relevant factors.
        - **Demand Forecasting**: Estimating future demand for a product based on past sales and market trends.

        --- 

        ### Plots


        Linear Regression is often visualized using scatter plots and regression lines. Scatter plots show the distribution of data points, while the regression line represents the linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

        ---

        ### Abilities


        Linear Regression offers several benefits:

        - **Interpretability**: The linear equation's coefficients provide insights into the relationship between the features and the target variable.
        - **Simplicity**: Linear Regression is easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for both beginners and experts.
        - **Efficiency**: The training and prediction process is computationally efficient, allowing for quick model development.

        ---


        ### Pros and Cons


        **Pros:**
        - Linear Regression performs well when the relationship between the features and the target is linear.
        - It provides interpretability, allowing you to understand the impact of each feature on the target.
        - Linear Regression is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets.

        **Cons:**
        - Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship, which may not be suitable for datasets with complex non-linear relationships.
        - It is sensitive to outliers, which can significantly impact the model's performance.
        - Linear Regression is limited to modeling continuous numerical variables and may not be suitable for categorical or discrete targets.

        --- 

        ### Code:

        ```python
        from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        model.predict(X_test)
        ```

        ---

        In summary, Linear Regression is a powerful algorithm for predicting numerical values by fitting a linear equation to the data. It is widely used and offers interpretability, simplicity, and efficiency. However, it is important to consider its assumptions and limitations when applying it to real-world datasets.

        ### 🍁 Decision Tree

        Decision Tree is a versatile algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of regression, Decision Trees create a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It partitions the data based on the features to predict the numerical target variable.

        ---

        #### Examples

        Decision Trees can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as:

        - **Medical Diagnosis**: Predicting a patient's blood pressure based on symptoms, age, and other medical factors.
        - **Crop Yield Prediction**: Estimating the yield of a crop based on environmental factors, soil quality, and cultivation techniques.
        - **Insurance Premium Estimation**: Determining the appropriate insurance premium for a policyholder based on risk factors like age, occupation, and health status.

        ---

        #### Plots

        Decision Trees can be visualized as tree-like structures, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf node represents the predicted value. The depth of the tree determines the complexity of the model.


        ---

        #### Abilities

        Decision Trees offer several benefits:

        - **Interpretability**: Decision Trees provide a clear and interpretable representation of decision-making logic.
        - **Handling Non-linearity**: Decision Trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
        - **Feature Importance**: Decision Trees can identify important features for prediction, aiding feature selection.

        ---

        #### Pros and Cons

        **Pros:**
        - Decision Trees can handle both numerical and categorical features.
        - They can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
        - Decision Trees are computationally efficient and can handle large datasets.

        **Cons:**
        - Decision Trees are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree becomes too deep.
        - They can be sensitive to small variations in the training data, leading to different tree structures.
        - Decision Trees may not generalize well to unseen data if the training data is not representative.

        ---

        ### Code

        ```python
        from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
        model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        model.predict(X_test)
        ```

        --- 

        In summary, Decision Trees are powerful regression algorithms that create tree-like models to predict numerical values. They offer interpretability, handle non-linearity, and provide feature importance information. However, caution should be exercised to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability.

        <br>

        ### 🌳 Random Forest

        Random Forest is a powerful ensemble algorithm that combines multiple Decision Trees to create a robust regression model. It belongs to the family of ensemble methods, which aim to improve prediction performance by aggregating the predictions of multiple individual models.

        ---

        #### Ensemble Algorithms

        Ensemble methods work by combining the predictions of multiple models, often referred to as base models or weak learners, to make a final prediction. These base models are trained on different subsets of the training data or with different features to introduce diversity in their predictions. The ensemble then combines these predictions using various techniques to arrive at a final prediction.

        ---

        #### Characteristics of Random Forest

        Random Forest has the following characteristics:

        - **Multiple Decision Trees**: Random Forest consists of a collection of Decision Trees, each trained on a random subset of the training data.
        - **Bootstrap Aggregation**: The subsets of data for training each Decision Tree are created through a process called bootstrap aggregation or bagging. This involves random sampling of the training data with replacement.
        - **Feature Randomness**: In addition to data randomness, Random Forest also introduces feature randomness. Each Decision Tree is trained on a random subset of features, which helps to decorrelate the trees and increase diversity.

        ---

        #### Strengths of Random Forest

        Random Forest offers several strengths as a regression algorithm:

        - **Improved Generalization**: By combining predictions from multiple Decision Trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting and improves generalization performance.
        - **Robustness to Outliers and Noisy Data**: Random Forest is less sensitive to outliers and noisy data compared to individual Decision Trees.
        - **Feature Importance**: Random Forest provides a measure of feature importance, which helps in identifying the most influential features in the prediction.

        ---

        #### Other Factors in Ensemble Methods

        Ensemble methods, including Random Forest, exhibit the following factors:

        - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Ensemble methods aim to strike a balance between bias and variance. Individual models with low bias and high variance can be combined to obtain a lower overall variance while maintaining reasonable bias.
        - **Parallelizability**: Ensemble methods can be easily parallelized, allowing for efficient training and prediction on large datasets.
        - **Model Diversity**: The performance of an ensemble relies on the diversity of the individual models. The base models should be different from each other in terms of the data they are trained on or the features they use.

        ---

        ### Code

        ```python
        from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
        model = RandomForestRegressor()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        model.predict(X_test)
        ```

        ---

        In summary, Random Forest is an ensemble algorithm that combines multiple Decision Trees to create a robust regression model.

        ### ⛑️ Support Vector Regression

        Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a powerful regression algorithm that utilizes the principles of Support Vector Machines to perform regression tasks. Similar to its classification counterpart, SVR aims to find a hyperplane that best fits the data points while maximizing the margin.

        ---

        #### Characteristics of Support Vector Regression

        SVR has the following characteristics:

        - **Kernel Trick**: SVR employs the kernel trick, allowing it to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicitly calculating the transformations. This enables SVR to capture complex nonlinear relationships between the features and the target variable.
        - **Margin Maximization**: SVR seeks to find a hyperplane that maintains a maximum margin while tolerating a certain amount of error, known as the epsilon-tube. Data points outside this epsilon-tube are considered outliers.
        - **Support Vectors**: SVR uses a subset of training data points called support vectors, which lie on or within the margin or the epsilon-tube. These support vectors heavily influence the position and orientation of the regression hyperplane.

        ---

        #### Strengths of Support Vector Regression

        Support Vector Regression offers several strengths as a regression algorithm:

        - **Flexibility**: SVR can effectively model both linear and nonlinear relationships between features and the target variable by utilizing different kernel functions, such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), or sigmoid.
        - **Robustness to Outliers**: SVR is robust to outliers, as it focuses on maximizing the margin and is less influenced by individual data points lying outside the margin or the epsilon-tube.
        - **Regularization**: SVR incorporates a regularization parameter, C, which controls the tradeoff between minimizing the training error and the complexity of the model. This allows for controlling overfitting and improving generalization.

        ---

        #### Considerations when using Support Vector Regression

        When working with Support Vector Regression, it's important to consider the following:

        - **Feature Scaling**: Feature scaling, such as normalization or standardization, is crucial when using SVR. SVR is sensitive to the scale of the features, and unscaled features may lead to suboptimal performance.
        - **Model Complexity**: SVR's performance is highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters, including the kernel function, regularization parameter C, and kernel-specific parameters. Proper tuning of these hyperparameters is essential for achieving optimal performance.
        - **Computational Complexity**: SVR's training time can be relatively higher compared to some other regression algorithms, especially for large datasets. Additionally, the memory requirements for storing support vectors can be significant.

        ---

        ### Code

        ```python
        from sklearn.svm import SVR
        model = SVR()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        model.predict(X_test)
        ```

        --- 

        In summary, Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a flexible regression algorithm that can effectively model linear and nonlinear relationships. It utilizes the kernel trick, maximizes the margin, and employs support vectors to influence the regression hyperplane. SVR is robust to outliers, provides regularization, but requires proper feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

        ### 🏘️ K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

        K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful non-parametric algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of regression, KNN predicts the target variable of a new data point by considering the average or weighted average of its K nearest neighbors.

        --- 

        #### Characteristics of K Nearest Neighbors

        KNN exhibits the following characteristics:

        - **Lazy Learning**: KNN is often referred to as a "lazy algorithm" because it doesn't have a traditional training phase. Instead, it stores the entire training dataset and performs computations only when making predictions on new data points. This makes the training time relatively short but can lead to longer testing times.
        - **Distance-based Similarity**: KNN determines the proximity between data points based on a distance metric, commonly Euclidean distance. The K nearest neighbors of a given data point are identified based on their distance to that point.
        - **Non-Parametric**: KNN makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it a non-parametric algorithm. It doesn't require any assumptions about the functional form of the relationship between the features and the target variable.

        ---

        #### Strengths of K Nearest Neighbors

        K Nearest Neighbors offers several strengths as a regression algorithm:

        - **Flexibility**: KNN can handle both linear and non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. It is capable of capturing complex patterns in the data, making it suitable for a wide range of regression tasks.
        - **Interpretability**: KNN provides transparency in the decision-making process. Predictions are made based on the actual values of neighboring data points, allowing for easy interpretation of results.
        - **Non-Parametric Nature**: KNN's non-parametric nature makes it more robust to outliers and less sensitive to skewed data distributions compared to parametric regression algorithms.

        ---

        #### Considerations when using K Nearest Neighbors

        When working with K Nearest Neighbors, it's important to consider the following:

        - **Feature Scaling**: Feature scaling is essential when using KNN, as it relies on the distance metric to identify neighbors. Features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculation, leading to biased results. Therefore, it's recommended to scale the features before applying KNN.
        - **Choosing the Value of K**: The choice of the parameter K, representing the number of nearest neighbors, is critical. A small value of K may lead to overfitting, while a large value may lead to underfitting. It's important to experiment with different values of K and choose the optimal value through cross-validation or other evaluation techniques.
        - **Computational Complexity**: KNN's testing time can be relatively high, especially for large datasets, as it requires calculating distances between the new data point and all training data points. Therefore, efficient data structures and algorithms, such as KD-trees or Ball-trees, can be employed to speed up the nearest neighbor search process.

        ---

        ### Code

        ```python
        from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
        model = KNeighborsRegressor(k=5) # k is the number of neighbors (we will talk about it later)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        model.predict(X_test)
        ```

        ---

        In summary, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a flexible and interpretable regression algorithm. Its non-parametric nature and ability to capture complex patterns make it a suitable choice for various regression tasks. However, careful consideration should be given to feature scaling, choosing the value of K, and the computational complexity associated with larger datasets.

The Purpose of Evaluation Metrics is to evaluate the performance of the model. We use the evaluation metrics to compare between different models and choose the best one. We also use the evaluation metrics to evaluate the model on the testing set. The evaluation metrics are different from one problem to another. For example, we use different evaluation metrics for classification problems and regression problems. In this section, we will talk about the evaluation metrics for regression problems.

        ### Usage

        MAE is used to assess the overall accuracy of a regression model. It is particularly useful when the magnitude of errors is essential and needs to be measured in the original units of the target variable. MAE provides a straightforward interpretation of the average absolute error.

        ### Interpretation

        A lower MAE value indicates better performance, as it represents a smaller average difference between the predicted and actual values. It measures the average magnitude of errors without considering their direction, making it less sensitive to outliers.

        ### Pros and Cons

        #### Pros:
        - **Intuitive Interpretation**: MAE is easy to interpret as it represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
        - **Robust to Outliers**: MAE is less affected by outliers since it treats all errors with equal importance.
        - **Same Scale as the Target Variable**: MAE is in the same units as the target variable, making it easy to relate to the problem domain.

        #### Cons:
        - **Lack of Sensitivity to Error Magnitude**: MAE treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude. It may not adequately penalize large errors if precise estimation of error magnitude is required.
        - **Does Not Provide Directional Information**: MAE does not indicate the direction of errors, making it difficult to identify whether the model tends to overestimate or underestimate the target variable.

        The MAE metric is a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of regression models, providing an intuitive measure of the average absolute error. However, it is essential to consider the specific requirements of the problem and the trade-offs between different evaluation metrics.

                ###   Overview of Classification Models

        Classification models are a class of machine learning models used for predicting categorical or discrete class labels. In this section, we will provide an overview of classification models and their key concepts.

        ####   Binary Classification

        Binary classification is a type of classification task where the goal is to predict one of two possible classes. The model learns from labeled data and assigns new instances to one of the two classes based on the learned patterns. Common algorithms used for binary classification include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees.

        ####  Multiclass Classification

        Multiclass classification involves predicting one class out of three or more possible classes. It extends binary classification to handle multiple classes. The model learns from labeled data with multiple classes and assigns new instances to one of the classes. Algorithms like random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and neural networks are commonly used for multiclass classification.

                                ## 📦 Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. It models the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating the probabilities using a logistic function.

### How It Works

Logistic Regression works by fitting a logistic curve to the training data, which allows it to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. It uses the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, to map the input values to a range between 0 and 1.

### Equation

The logistic function used in Logistic Regression is given by the following equation:

                st.markdown("""

where:

- $f(x)$: Logistic function
- $e$: Euler's number
- $x$: Input value


<br> 

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros:
- **Interpretability**: Logistic Regression provides interpretable coefficients that indicate the influence of each feature on the prediction.
- **Efficiency**: Logistic Regression is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets.
- **Works well with linearly separable data**: Logistic Regression performs well when the decision boundary between classes is linear.

#### Cons:
- **Assumption of linearity**: Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.
- **Limited to binary classification**: Logistic Regression is primarily used for binary classification tasks and may not perform well for multi-class problems without modifications.

                                ## 🍁 Decision Tree

Decision Tree is a popular algorithm for classification tasks. It builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences based on the features of the data. Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome or class label.

### How It Works

Decision Tree works by recursively splitting the data based on the values of the features to create homogeneous subsets. The splits are made based on certain criteria, such as Gini impurity or information gain, to maximize the homogeneity or purity of the subsets with respect to the target variable.

<br>

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros:
- **Interpretability**: Decision Trees provide intuitive interpretations as they mimic human decision-making processes.
- **Handling both numerical and categorical data**: Decision Trees can handle both numerical and categorical features without requiring extensive preprocessing.
- **Feature importance**: Decision Trees can rank the importance of features based on their contribution to the splits.

#### Cons:
- **Overfitting**: Decision Trees have a tendency to overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Techniques like pruning can be applied to alleviate this issue.
- **Instability**: Decision Trees are sensitive to small changes in the data and can produce different trees with different splits.
- **Bias towards features with more levels**: Decision Trees with categorical features tend to favor features with more levels or categories.

                                ## 🌳 Random Forest

Random Forest is a popular ensemble algorithm for classification tasks. It combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate model. Each decision tree in the Random Forest is built on a random subset of the data and features.

### How It Works

Random Forest works by creating an ensemble of decision trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data through a process called bootstrap aggregating or "bagging." Additionally, for each split in the tree, a random subset of features is considered, reducing the correlation between trees. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the individual trees.

### Ensemble and Boosting

Random Forest is an ensemble algorithm because it combines multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong learner. Ensemble methods leverage the diversity of individual models to improve the overall prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

<br>

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros:
- **High Accuracy**: Random Forest tends to achieve high accuracy due to the combination of multiple decision trees.
- **Robustness**: Random Forest is resistant to overfitting and performs well on a variety of datasets.
- **Feature Importance**: Random Forest can provide feature importance scores, indicating the contribution of each feature in the classification task.

#### Cons:
- **Computational Complexity**: Random Forest can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets or a large number of trees.
- **Lack of Interpretability**: The individual trees in the Random Forest are not easily interpretable, unlike a single decision tree.

###   Evaluation Metrics


To assess the performance of classification models, various evaluation metrics are used. Some commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances and its overall performance. <br> <br>
The Purpose of Evaluation Metrics is to evaluate the performance of the model. We use the evaluation metrics to compare between different models and choose the best one. We also use the evaluation metrics to evaluate the model on the testing set. The evaluation metrics are different from one problem to another. For example, we use different evaluation metrics for classification problems and regression problems. In this section, we will talk about the evaluation metrics for classification problems. <br> <br> 
Some Metrics has high importance than others. For example, in the case of imbalanced data, we use the F1-score instead of accuracy. Also, in Medical problems, the recall is more important than precision.

## 󠁪󠁪󠁪󠁪󠁪💢 Confusion Matrix

The Confusion Matrix is a performance measurement for classification models that summarizes the results of the predictions made by the model on a set of test data. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance by counting the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions.

<br>

### Understanding TP, TN, FP, and FN

- **True Positive (TP)**: The number of positive instances correctly predicted by the model as positive. These are the cases where the model predicted the class correctly.
- **True Negative (TN)**: The number of negative instances correctly predicted by the model as negative. These are the cases where the model predicted the absence of the class correctly.
- **False Positive (FP)**: The number of negative instances incorrectly predicted by the model as positive. These are the cases where the model predicted the presence of the class, but it was not present in reality.
- **False Negative (FN)**: The number of positive instances incorrectly predicted by the model as negative. These are the cases where the model predicted the absence of the class, but it was present in reality.

<br>

### Example Confusion Matrix

|         | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Actual Negative** | True Negative (TN) | False Positive (FP) |
| **Actual Positive** | False Negative (FN) | True Positive (TP) |

<br>

Here's an example confusion matrix to illustrate how TP, TN, FP, and FN are arranged in a tabular form:


|         | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Actual Negative** | 90 | 10 |
| **Actual Positive** | 15 | 85 |

<br>

In this example, we have a binary classification problem with two classes: Negative and Positive. The model correctly predicted 90 instances as Negative (TN), incorrectly predicted 10 instances as Positive (FP), incorrectly predicted 15 instances as Negative (FN), and correctly predicted 85 instances as Positive (TP).

The Confusion Matrix provides valuable insights into the performance of the classification model, allowing us to calculate various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Usage and Interpretation

Accuracy is commonly used to assess the performance of a classification model, especially when the classes in the dataset are balanced (approximately equal number of instances for each class). It provides an overall measure of how well the model predicts both positive and negative instances.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Provides a straightforward and intuitive evaluation of model performance.
- Suitable for balanced datasets or when the cost of misclassification for both classes is similar.
- Easy to interpret and communicate to stakeholders.

**Cons:** - Accuracy alone may not be a reliable measure when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class 
dominates the others in terms of the number of instances. - It does not provide information about the specific types 
of errors the model is making (e.g., false positives or false negatives). - Accuracy may give misleading results when 
applied to datasets with varying class distributions or when the cost of misclassification differs significantly
